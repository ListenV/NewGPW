<Heading1 id="content">Requests Rules</Heading1>

<Heading2 id="1">1. Do not make requests for torrents that break the rules</Heading2>

It is your responsibility that the request follows the rules. Otherwise,your request will be deleted, and you will not get your bounty back.

<Heading2 id="2">2. Do not request multiple torrents in a single request</Heading2>

This means no requesting two movies (ie: I am looking for Casablanca and Fight Club) or requesting two torrents of the same movie (ie: I want a high definition rip and a 700MiB AVI) in one request. You may ask for multiple formats, but you cannot specify all of them.

<Heading2 id="3">3. Do not unfill requests for trivial reasons</Heading2>

If you did not specify in your request what you wanted (such as bitrates or a particular edition), do not unfill and later change the description. Do not unfill requests if you are unsure of what you are doing (e.g. the filled torrent may be a transcode, but you don't know how to tell). Ask for help from [first-line support or staff](/staff.php) in that case. You may unfill the request if the torrent does not fit your specifications stated clearly in the request.

<Heading2 id="4">4. All users must have an equal chance to fill a request</Heading2>

Trading upload credit is not allowed. Abusing the request system to exchange favors for other users is not tolerated, that includes making specific requests for certain users (whether explicitly named or not). Making requests for releases, and then unfilling so that one particular user can fill the request is not allowed. If reported, both the requester and user filling the request will receive a warning and lose the request bounty.

<Heading2 id="5">5. No manipulation of the requester for bounty</Heading2>

The bounty is a reward for helping other users&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;it should not be a ransom. Any user who refuses to fill a request unless the bounty is increased will face harsh punishment.
