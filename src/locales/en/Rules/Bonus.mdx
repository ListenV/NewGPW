<Heading1 id="content">Bonus Point Rules</Heading1>

Bonus points are an incentive to all users to help seed while receiving bonus points for seeding activity and uploading. These bonus points can be used to trade for freeleech tokens, ~a badge, ~an invite, a custom title, and other stuff found at the [Bonus Store](bonus.php). You may also view your current [Bonus Point Rates](bonus.php?action=bprates).

<Heading2 id="seeding">1. Seeding BP</Heading2>

Bonus points are calculated through the formula: **BP/hour = Size × (0.025 + (0.06 × ln(1 + Seedtime) ÷ (Seeders^0.6)))**

Size is in GiB, seedtime is in days, and seeders means the total seeder number of a particular torrent. This calculation is run once per hour.

So you can see:
1. The bigger and more you seed, the more BP you get;
1. The longer you seed, the more BP you get;
1. Less the seeder at the same time, the more BP you get;
1. You will get extra BP if you are the only seeder.
