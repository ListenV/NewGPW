<Heading1 id="content">Invite Rules</Heading1>

The [invite page](user.php?action=invite) is where you may invite friends to the site. GPW has strict invite rules every user must follow. These are found in the [Golden Rules](rules.php). This page serves as a summary of the invite guidelines and will trump the Golden Rules if ever there is a discrepancy.

**Note: Please be sure to strictly abide by the invite rules. Violating users put their accounts at risk.**

<Heading2 id="invite-rules">2. Invite Rules</Heading2>

- **Only invite people you know and trust**
    - Invites are meant mainly for friends you know personally. You can invite internet friends, but only if you've known them for a long time and you trust them. GPW staff will monitor invitees at any given time.
- **Do not invite bad users. You will be held responsible for the users you invite**
    - Invited users who are not able to maintain their ratios will not affect your account. However, invitees who violate the Golden Rules may put your account or privileges at risk.
- **Each user is allowed only one account per lifetime**
    - Do not invite any user who has previously had a GPW account. If ever an account is found to be a duplicate, all associating accounts along with the duplicate will be banned. Inviting previously banned users may put your account at risk as well. If they wish to re-enable or recover their account, please refer them to the Telegram group for these matters: [GPW - Disabled](https://t.me/joinchat/77iO6zI6CF85Zjll).
- **Trading invites is prohibited**
    - Exchanging invites for access to other private trackers, forums, and the like is not allowed.
- **Selling invites is prohibited**
    - Making a profit by selling invites to other users is not allowed.
- **Giving away invites to random users or offering invites in public is not allowed**
    - Do not offer invites or respond to invite requests in public areas, including but not limited to message boards, forums, ~~social media,~~sites easily indexed by a search engine, or anywhere that is not a class-restricted/private area. (Exception: people who are selected by GPW Staff can offer invites at the particular place.)
- **Please stay away from inviting trading/selling forums**
    - Inviting a user from these sites will most likely get your account and entire invite tree banned.
