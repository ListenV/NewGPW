<Heading1 id="content">Collages Rules</Heading1>

1. Collages are not used for a list of an actor/actress or director's filmography as the artist pages already exist for this purpose.

2. Every collage must have at least 3 torrent groups in it, except for collages of type "Production Company", "Personal", and "Staff Picks".

3. Vandalizing of collages will be taken very seriously, resulting in collage editing privileges being removed (at a minimum).

4. If something is a published Best Of (for instance, "Best Movies of the 1990's") then it should refer to a respected critic, filmmaker, actor, or publication. You may not make a collage for your favorite movies, unless it is a personal collage (available to Power User and above).

5. Collages may focus on: genres, production companies, winners/nominees of awards, a series of movies, or any other quantifiable thing that would connect a group of movies together (eg: Horror Film Remakes, Films about the War in the Middle East, etc).

6. Please check to see that a similar collage does not already exist. If a similar collage does exist, please contribute to the existing collage.

7. Make sure the movies fit with the given theme or meet any requirements in the Collage Information before you add them to a specific collage.

8. Please give your collage an appropriate title and a decent description explaining its purpose.

9. Collages can be locked by a staff. A locked collage is either definitive or updated regularly. If you find a locked collage missing movies or having other errors, feel free to report it.

10. If you are unsure if a collage follows all of the above rules, send a [Staff PM](/staff.php) before creating one.
