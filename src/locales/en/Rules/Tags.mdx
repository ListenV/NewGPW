<Heading1 id="content">Tagging Rules</Heading1>

1. Tags should be comma-separated (`,`), and you should use a period (`.`) to separate words inside a tag. Such as `sci.fi` or `post.rock`.

2. You can select from the dropdown box on [the torrent upload page](/upload.php). We recommend adding more specific sub-genres manually, but it is fine to use only these official tags if you do not feel qualified to be more specific. Please note that the `2000s` tag refers to music produced between 2000 and 2009.

3. Do not add 'useless' tags, such as personal opinions or anything you specify elsewhere on the form, `seen.live`, `awesome`, `kung.fu` (containing in `action`) etc.. If an upload contains live contents, you can tag it as `live`.

4. Only tag information on the movie itselfâ€”not the individual release. Tags such as `remux`, `encode`, `blu.ray`, `eac3to` etc. are strictly forbidden. Remember that these tags will be used for other versions of the same movie.

5. If you have questions about the dropdown box on [the torrent upload page](/upload.php), please don't add the tag.
