## About donation <Important>(IMPORTANT)</Important>

Thank you for coming to donation page, your support will help {props.SITE_NAME}'s survival. If you are financially able, help pay {props.SITE_NAME}'s bills by donating. Before you donate, you need to know and confirm these things:

1. {props.SITE_NAME} is a nonprofit organization and not sponsored, and provides its services free of charge. Supporting {props.SITE_NAME} is and will always remain voluntary.
2. {props.SITE_NAME} uses all voluntary donations to cover the costs of running the site, tracker, and IRC network. These costs represent the hardware the site runs on (e.g. servers, upgrades, fixes, etc.), and recurring operating expenses (e.g. hosting, bandwidth, power, etc.).
3. When you donate you aren't paying the {props.SITE_NAME} Staff, purchasing upload credit, or buying the ability to download. No staff member or other individual responsible for the site's operation personally profits from user donations.
4. Be reminded that when you make a donation, you aren't "purchasing" Donor Ranks, invites, or any {props.SITE_NAME}-specific benefit. And users cannot fetch their lost privileges (e.g. account locked, download privilege banned etc.) or accounts by donating. When donating, you are helping {props.SITE_NAME} pay its bills, and your donation should be made in this spirit.
5. {props.SITE_NAME} forbid people to gain accounts by donation permanently. Any invite by trading is individual behavior. Any account comes from trading will cause buyer and seller's accounts banned and will not be recovered forever.
6. {props.SITE_NAME}'s Donor Rank system is currently available to all credited donors. This system provides donors with perks. Some of these perks are cosmetic (e.g. a donor icon added to your account), some are one-time benefits (e.g. additional invites), and others modify specific site options (e.g. additional profile information boxes, or personal collages).
